# Game-control-using-computer-vision
Built a game control system using computer vision. Using this system, any game can be controlled by hand movement or by object tracking with 60 FPS live webcam video feed.
To execute the program, open the game and run the gcot code.
 Languages/Software packages/Algorithms used: Python, opencv2, directkeys, HSV image thresholding.
The code also contains direct keys, which I have used from the below link:
